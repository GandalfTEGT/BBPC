<h2>Requirements for Warranty Claims</h2>
<p>
  To process your claim efficiently, we need the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Valid proof of purchase (Amazon, retailer receipt, or BonnieByte PC order)</li>
  <li>Full product name and model (e.g., <span class="orbitron notranslate">{{ p.html_name }}</span>)</li>
  <li>A description of the symptoms or failure</li>
  <li>Photos or videos showing the issue if possible</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Missing information may delay your claim, but we’ll always work with you to resolve things.
