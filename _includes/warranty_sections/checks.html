<h2>Before Submitting a Claim</h2>
<p>
  Most issues can be resolved quickly with a few simple checks.  
  These are the same steps our support team will ask about:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure all cables are fully seated and correctly matched (especially ARGB 5V vs RGB 12V)</li>
  <li>Test the product on a different header or device if possible</li>
  <li>Check your motherboard BIOS settings for fan and ARGB control</li>
  <li>Try a different SATA or power cable if using a hub</li>
  <li>Confirm that controller buttons / software haven’t overridden your preferred settings</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If these steps don’t solve it — don’t worry.  
  We’ll pick it up from there.
