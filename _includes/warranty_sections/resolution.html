<h2>How We Resolve Warranty Issues</h2>
<p>
  Once we confirm a warranty-eligible fault, you’ll receive one of the following solutions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Replacement:</strong> A new or equivalent part shipped to you.</li>
  <li><strong>Repair:</strong> If a repair is practical and fast.</li>
  <li><strong>Refund:</strong> In rare cases where a replacement is unavailable.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We aim to resolve most cases within a few business days after receiving the required information.
