            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This Shipping Policy explains how we handle delivery of BonnieByte PC products when you
                purchase directly from our website (via our future Shopify store). Amazon orders are
                covered separately by Amazon’s own shipping and delivery policies.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Fulfilment Methods</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Direct website orders</h3>
            <p>
                For orders placed directly through our website, we pack and ship your order ourselves
                from our storage location in Dundee, Scotland.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Amazon orders</h3>
            <p>
                If you buy from our official Amazon UK store, your order will usually be fulfilled by
                Amazon using their own logistics network. Amazon’s delivery estimates and shipping
                policies apply in those cases.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Shipping Destinations</h2>
            <p>
                Initially, we expect to ship directly only within the United Kingdom. As our business
                grows, we may add more destinations and will update this page when we do.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Processing Times</h2>
            <p>
                We aim to process and dispatch direct website orders within:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1–2 business days</strong> after payment is confirmed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Business days are Monday to Friday, excluding UK public holidays. Orders placed at weekends
                or on holidays will be processed on the next business day where possible.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Delivery Times</h2>
            <p>
                Once dispatched, typical delivery times for UK orders are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard UK delivery:</strong> 2–4 business days</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Actual delivery times may vary depending on your location, the time of year, and courier
                performance. We will always provide realistic estimates at checkout.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Shipping Costs</h2>
            <p>
                Shipping costs for direct website orders will be shown clearly at checkout before you
                confirm your order.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may offer:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flat-rate shipping for UK orders</li>
                <li>Free shipping above a certain order value</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Specific rates and any free shipping thresholds will be confirmed on the website and may
                change over time.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Order Tracking</h2>
            <p>
                Depending on the shipping method used, your order may include tracking. Where tracking is
                available, we will normally provide a tracking number or link in your dispatch confirmation
                email.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Failed Delivery &amp; Returns to Sender</h2>
            <p>
                If a delivery cannot be completed due to an incorrect address, repeated missed delivery
                attempts, or failure to collect from a local depot, the parcel may be returned to us.
            </p>
            <p>
                In these cases, we can:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Re-send the order to a corrected address (additional shipping charges may apply)</li>
                <li>Offer a refund minus the original shipping cost, if appropriate</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Lost or Delayed Shipments</h2>
            <p>
                If you believe your order is lost or significantly delayed, please contact us with your
                order details. We will:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check the status with the courier</li>
                <li>Begin an investigation if necessary</li>
                <li>Offer a replacement or refund where a parcel is confirmed lost</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>10. Damaged Shipments</h2>
            <p>
                If your order arrives with visible damage to the packaging or product, please:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take clear photos of the damage</li>
                <li>Retain all packaging materials</li>
                <li>Contact us as soon as possible with your order number and photos</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We will work with you to arrange a replacement, refund, or other suitable resolution in
                line with our Returns &amp; Refund Policy and your consumer rights.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
                We may update this Shipping Policy from time to time, for example when we add new shipping
                options or destinations. The “Last Updated” date at the top of this page will reflect the
                latest version.
