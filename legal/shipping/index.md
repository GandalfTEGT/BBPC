<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>This Shipping Policy explains how we handle delivery of BonnieByte PC products when you purchase directly from our website (via our future Shopify store). Amazon orders are covered separately by Amazon’s own shipping and delivery policies.</p>
<h2>2. Fulfilment Methods</h2>
<h3>2.1 Direct Website Orders</h3>
<p>For orders placed directly through our website, we pack and ship your order from our storage location in Dundee, Scotland.</p>
<h3>2.2 Amazon Orders</h3>
<p>If you purchase from our official Amazon UK store, your order will usually be fulfilled by Amazon using their logistics network. Amazon’s shipping estimates and delivery policies apply in these cases.</p>
<h2>3. Shipping Destinations</h2>
<p>Initially, direct website orders will be shipped only within the United Kingdom. As our business grows, we may add additional destinations and will update this page accordingly.</p>
<h2>4. Processing Times</h2>
<p>We aim to process and dispatch direct orders within:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1–2 business days</strong> after payment is confirmed</li>
</ul>
<p>Business days are Monday to Friday, excluding UK public holidays. Orders placed at weekends or on holidays will be processed on the next business day where possible.</p>
<h2>5. Delivery Times</h2>
<p>Once dispatched, typical delivery times for UK orders are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard UK delivery:</strong> 2–4 business days</li>
</ul>
<p>Delivery times may vary depending on your location, time of year, and courier performance. Estimated delivery times will be shown at checkout.</p>
<h2>6. Shipping Costs</h2>
<p>Shipping costs for direct website orders will be displayed clearly at checkout before you confirm your order.</p>
<p>We may offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flat-rate UK shipping</li>
<li>Free shipping above a certain order value</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific rates and thresholds will be shown during checkout and may change over time.</p>
<h2>7. Order Tracking</h2>
<p>Depending on the shipping method used, your order may include tracking. Where tracking is available, you will receive a tracking link or number in your dispatch confirmation email.</p>
<h2>8. Failed Delivery &amp; Returns to Sender</h2>
<p>If a delivery cannot be completed due to an incorrect address, repeated missed delivery attempts, or failure to collect from a local depot, the parcel may be returned to us.</p>
<p>In such cases, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-send the order to a corrected address (additional shipping charges may apply)</li>
<li>Offer a refund minus the original shipping cost, where appropriate</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. Lost or Delayed Shipments</h2>
<p>If you believe your order is lost or significantly delayed, please contact us with your order details. We will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the status with the courier</li>
<li>Begin an investigation if necessary</li>
<li>Offer a replacement or refund if the parcel is confirmed lost</li>
</ul>
<h2>10. Damaged Shipments</h2>
<p>If your order arrives with visible damage to the packaging or product, please:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take clear photos of the damage</li>
<li>Retain all packaging materials</li>
<li>Contact us as soon as possible with your order number and photos</li>
</ul>
<p>We will work with you to arrange a replacement, refund, or other appropriate resolution in line with our Returns &amp; Refund Policy and your consumer rights.</p>
<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Shipping Policy from time to time, for example when new shipping options or destinations are added. The “Last Updated” date at the top of this page will reflect the latest version.</p>
