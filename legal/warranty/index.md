<h2>1. Summary</h2>
<p>Your <span class="orbitron notranslate">NORTHERN WIND</span> 120mm ARGB fan bundle is covered by a <strong>2-year limited warranty</strong> from the date of purchase. If a failure occurs due to a manufacturing defect, we will repair it, replace the faulty component, or replace the full bundle where appropriate. Clear, fair, and hassle-free.</p>
<h2>2. Who Is Covered?</h2>
<p>This warranty applies to the <strong>original purchaser</strong> only. Products must be purchased from an authorised retailer, including our official Amazon UK store or our future direct website store.</p>

<li>Complete ARGB lighting failure (full ring non-functional)</li>
<li>Controller hub failure (no PWM output, no power, no ARGB passthrough)</li>
<li>Faulty PWM or ARGB cables</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. What’s Not Covered?</h2>
<p>This warranty does not apply to issues caused by:</p>
<ul>

<li>Incorrect installation or forcing connector pins</li>
<li>Connecting ARGB to a 12V RGB header</li>
<li>Short circuits, exposed wires, electrical misuse</li>

<li>Small LED brightness variances or slight colour blending</li>
<li>Minor motor hum at low RPM (normal PWM behaviour)</li>

<li>Unauthorised repairs or modifications</li>

</ul>
<h2>5. The BonnieByte Promise</h2>
<p>We build our products to last, and if something goes wrong, we fix it quickly. No complicated forms, no arguing over minor issues — fast, fair, friendly support.</p>
<h2>6. Quick Checks (Before Contacting Support)</h2>
<h3>RGB / Lighting Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure ARGB is connected to a <strong>5V 3-pin</strong> header (not 12V RGB)</li>
<li>Check alignment arrows on connectors</li>
<li>Try a different ARGB port on the hub</li>
<li>Disable motherboard LED overrides if applicable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fan Not Spinning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the PWM cable is fully inserted</li>
<li>Check BIOS is set to <strong>PWM mode</strong> instead of DC</li>
<li>Try a different hub port</li>
<li>Test with a known-working cable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hub Not Responding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Confirm SATA power is connected correctly</li>
<li>Ensure ARGB and PWM leads are attached</li>
<li>Check for hub LED indicators</li>
</ul>
<p>If these checks don’t resolve the issue, we’ll take it from there.</p>
<h2>7. What We Will Do</h2>
