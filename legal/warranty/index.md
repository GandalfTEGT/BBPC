<h2>1. Summary</h2>
<p>Your {{ page.product_name_html }} ({{ page.product_name }}, SKU: {{ page.product_sku }}) is covered by a <strong>2-year limited warranty</strong> from the date of purchase. If a failure occurs due to a manufacturing defect, we will repair it, replace the faulty component, or replace the full {{ page.product_short }} bundle where appropriate.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fan motor failure or non-spinning behaviour</li>
<li>Complete ARGB lighting failure (full ring non-functional)</li>
<li>Controller hub failure (no PWM output, no power, no ARGB passthrough)</li>
<li>Faulty PWM or ARGB cables</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. What’s Not Covered?</h2>

<ul>

<li>Incorrect installation or forcing connector pins</li>

<h2>5. The BonnieByte Promise</h2>
<p>We build our products to last. If something goes wrong with your {{ page.product_short }}, we fix it quickly — no complicated forms and no unnecessary delays.</p>
<h2>6. Quick Checks (Before Contacting Support)</h2>
<h3>RGB / Lighting Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure ARGB is connected to a <strong>5V 3-pin</strong> header (not 12V RGB)</li>
<li>Check alignment arrows on connectors</li>
<li>Try a different ARGB port on the hub</li>
<li>Disable motherboard LED overrides if applicable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fan Not Spinning</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the PWM cable is fully inserted</li>
<li>Check BIOS is set to <strong>PWM mode</strong> instead of DC</li>
<li>Try a different hub port</li>
<li>Test with a known-working cable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hub Not Responding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Confirm SATA power is connected correctly</li>
<li>Ensure ARGB and PWM leads are attached</li>
<li>Check for hub LED indicators</li>
</ul>
<p>If these checks don’t resolve the issue, we’ll take it from there.</p>
