            <h2>4. Products and Orders</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Amazon orders</h3>
            <p>
                Many of our products are sold via Amazon.co.uk. When you purchase through Amazon,
                your contract of sale is with Amazon, and their Terms & Conditions and policies apply
                in addition to our own warranty and support commitments.
            </p>

            <h3>4.2 Direct-to-consumer (Shopify) orders</h3>
            <p>
                In the future, we may offer the ability to purchase directly from our website using a
                Shopify-based store. When you place an order directly with us:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You confirm that all information you provide is accurate and complete</li>
                <li>You confirm that you are authorised to use the chosen payment method</li>
                <li>Your order is only accepted when we send an order confirmation email</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.3 Pricing and availability</h3>
            <p>
                We do our best to ensure that product information, pricing, and availability are accurate.
                However, we reserve the right to correct errors, update prices, or change product details
                at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we discover an error in the price or description of your order, we may cancel or amend
                the order after contacting you.
            </p>

            <h3>4.4 Right to refuse service</h3>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to refuse service, cancel orders, or restrict access to the website
                where we reasonably believe there has been misuse, fraud, or a breach of these Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
                All content on this website is either owned by BonnieByte PC or used with permission.
                This includes (but is not limited to):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Logos, branding, and graphics</li>
                <li>Text, product descriptions, and documentation</li>
                <li>Images, diagrams, and page layouts</li>
                <li>User manuals and guides</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from our content
                without our prior written permission, except as allowed by law (for example, printing
                a copy of the warranty or manual for personal use).
            </p>

            <h2>6. User-Generated Content</h2>
            <p>
                If, in the future, our site allows you to submit content (such as reviews or comments),
                you agree that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your content will be accurate and not misleading</li>
                <li>Your content will not be illegal, offensive, or infringe anyone else’s rights</li>
                <li>We may use, reproduce, and display your content in connection with our business</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Links to Other Websites</h2>
            <p>
                Our website may contain links to third-party websites (such as Amazon or social media).
                These websites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their content
                or policies. We recommend reading their terms and privacy policies.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability where it would be unlawful to
                do so, including for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of data</li>
                <li>Loss of profits, revenue, or business</li>
                <li>Any indirect or consequential loss or damage</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our total liability in relation to any product or service will not exceed the price
                you paid for that product or service, except where consumer law provides otherwise.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Your Consumer Rights</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms do not affect your statutory consumer rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you live in Scotland, England, Wales, or Northern Ireland, you are protected by
                UK consumer law, which may give you additional rights beyond what we set out here.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms are governed by the laws of Scotland. If you live elsewhere in the United
                Kingdom, your local mandatory consumer protection laws will still apply.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any disputes relating to these Terms will normally be handled by the Scottish courts,
                unless your local law requires a different approach.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last Updated”
                date at the top of this page. By continuing to use the website, you accept the revised Terms.
            </p>
