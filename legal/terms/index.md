        <p>
            We do our best to ensure that product information, pricing, and availability are accurate.
            However, we reserve the right to correct errors, update prices, or change product details
            at any time.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h2>6. User-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
            If, in the future, our site allows you to submit content (such as reviews or comments),
            you agree that:

        <h2>7. Links to Other Websites</h2>
        <p>
            Our website may contain links to third-party websites (such as Amazon or social media).
            These websites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their content
            or policies. We recommend reading their terms and privacy policies.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability where it would be unlawful to
            do so, including for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or for fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for:

        <ul>
            <li>Loss of data</li>
            <li>Loss of profits, revenue, or business</li>
            <li>Any indirect or consequential loss or damage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our total liability in relation to any product or service will not exceed the price
            you paid for that product or service, except where consumer law provides otherwise.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Your Consumer Rights</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
            If you live in Scotland, England, Wales, or Northern Ireland, you are protected by
            UK consumer law, which may give you additional rights beyond what we set out here.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of Scotland. If you live elsewhere in the United
            Kingdom, your local mandatory consumer protection laws will still apply.
        </p>
