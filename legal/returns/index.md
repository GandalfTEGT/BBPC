        <h1>Returns &amp; Refund Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 3 December 2025</p>
        <!-- TOC via warranty.js -->
        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
            We want you to be happy with your BonnieByte PC products. If something isn’t right, this
            Returns &amp; Refund Policy explains how returns, refunds, and exchanges work.
        </p>
        <p>
            This policy applies to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purchases made through our official Amazon UK store</li>
            <li>Future direct purchases made through our own online store (Shopify)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2. Return Window</h2>
        <p>
            You have up to <strong>30 days</strong> from the date you receive your product to request
            a return, in line with standard Amazon policies and UK consumer expectations.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Amazon Orders</h2>
        <p>
            If you purchased your BonnieByte PC product from Amazon:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Please use Amazon’s returns system to initiate a return or refund</li>
            <li>Amazon’s own Returns &amp; Refunds Policy will apply</li>
            <li>We are still happy to help with troubleshooting and warranty support</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For Amazon orders, your first point of contact should normally be the Amazon “Your Orders”
            page. If you have any difficulty, you can also email us for guidance.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Direct (Shopify) Orders – Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
            The following applies to orders placed directly on our website (when available):
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Return request made within 30 days of delivery</li>
            <li>Product in “as new” or “reasonable” condition</li>
            <li>All major accessories and components included (hub, fans, key cables)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4.1 Condition of returned items</h3>
        <p>
            Please make sure products are clean, safely packaged, and free from heavy damage.
        </p>
        <p>We may reduce the refund where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Items are missing major components</li>
            <li>There is obvious misuse or damage beyond normal handling</li>
            <li>Packaging is destroyed or heavily damaged (unless due to transit issues)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Non-Returnable Items</h2>
        <p>
            In general, we accept returns for most products we sell. However, we may not accept
            returns where:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A product has been severely physically damaged by misuse</li>
            <li>Components are missing or destroyed beyond reasonable repair</li>
            <li>The product has been modified (e.g. cables cut, PCBs altered)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Your statutory rights are not affected. If a product is faulty or not as described,
            you may still be entitled to a repair, replacement, or refund under UK consumer law.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Faulty or Defective Products</h2>
        <p>
            If your product is faulty, defective, or not working as expected, please contact us as
            soon as possible. Many issues can be resolved with quick troubleshooting, and if the
            product is genuinely faulty, you are protected by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our <strong>2-year Limited Warranty</strong></li>
            <li>Your statutory rights under UK consumer law</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the event of a confirmed fault, we may offer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Replacement of the defective component (e.g., a single fan or cable)</li>
            <li>Replacement of the full bundle where multiple parts are affected</li>
            <li>A refund where repair or replacement is not possible</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>7. How to Request a Return (Direct Orders)</h2>
        <p>

            <li>Reason for return</li>
            <li>Photos or video of any fault, if applicable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We will respond with next steps, which may include troubleshooting, a return authorisation,
            or a replacement plan.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Refund Process</h2>
        <p>
            Once we receive and inspect your returned item, we will notify you by email whether your
            refund has been approved.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approved refunds will be processed back to your original payment method</li>
            <li>Refund processing times depend on your bank or payment provider</li>
            <li>If a partial refund is appropriate (e.g. missing parts), we will explain this clearly</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>9. Return Shipping Costs</h2>
        <h3>9.1 Change of mind / no fault found</h3>
        <p>
            If you simply change your mind or the product is not suitable, you may be responsible for
            the cost of return shipping, unless otherwise required by law.
        </p>
        <h3>9.2 Faulty, damaged, or incorrect items</h3>
        <p>
            If your item is faulty, damaged in transit, or we have sent the wrong product, we will
            normally provide a pre-paid return label or reimburse reasonable return shipping costs.
        </p>
