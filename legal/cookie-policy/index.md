        <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 3 December 2025</p>
        <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>
            Cookies are small text files stored on your device to help websites function and remember preferences.
            Some cookies are <strong>essential</strong> for a website to operate, while others (such as analytics or
            advertising cookies) require your consent under UK GDPR and PECR.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Cookies We Use</h2>
        <p>
            BonnieByte PC currently uses <strong>only essential cookies</strong>. These are required for security,
            core functionality, accessibility, and your saved preferences.
        </p>
        <h3>2.1 Essential Cookies (No Consent Required)</h3>
        <p>The following cookies are required for our website to operate correctly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>bb_cookie_consent</strong> – Remembers whether you accepted or rejected optional cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>bb_theme</strong> – Stores your light/dark theme preference for accessibility.</li>
            <li><strong>bb_session_id</strong> – Creates an anonymous session identifier for site functions.</li>
            <li><strong>bb_csrf</strong> – Security token used to protect future forms from abuse.</li>
            <li><strong>bb_lang</strong> – Saves language/region preference for future localisation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These cookies do <strong>not</strong> track you, contain personal information, or share data with third
            parties. They exist strictly to provide a smooth and secure experience.
        </p>
        <h3>2.2 Functional Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            Functional cookies help the website remember user choices (such as theme or region). All current
            functional cookies used by BonnieByte PC are listed above as essential.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Analytics Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            We currently do <strong>not</strong> use analytics tools such as Google Analytics. If we introduce
            optional analytics in the future (for example, when our store launches), we will request your consent
            before enabling them.
        </p>
        <h3>2.4 Advertising Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            BonnieByte PC does <strong>not</strong> use advertising, retargeting, or tracking cookies.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Managing Cookies</h2>
        <p>You can manage cookies on our website in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Browser settings:</strong> You can block or delete cookies using your browser’s privacy options. This may affect functionality on some websites, but will not affect essential cookies on ours.</li>
            <li><strong>The cookie banner:</strong> When you first visit our site, you can choose to accept or reject optional cookies. At this time, we only use essential cookies, so rejecting optional cookies will not affect your experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Reset cookie preferences:</strong> You can reset your decision at any time using the “Reset Cookie Preferences” button below. 
                <button id="bbpc-scroll-to-reset" class="button button-secondary">
                    ↓
                </button> 
This will remove your previous choice and show the cookie banner again on your next visit.</li>
            <li><strong>Reset cookie preferences (footer link):</strong> You can also access the reset option from any page on our website using the “Change Cookie Settings” link found in the footer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This allows you to withdraw consent or change your preference easily if we introduce optional 
            analytics or other non-essential cookies in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rejecting optional cookies will not affect your ability to use our website, as we currently load only
            essential cookies.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <h3>4.1 MailerLite Newsletter Forms</h3>
        <p>
            Our newsletter signup form is powered by MailerLite. This may store functional data needed to submit
            your email securely, but no marketing or tracking cookies are loaded unless you explicitly consent in
            the future.
        </p>
        <h3>4.2 Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
        <p>
            Some forms may use Google reCAPTCHA for security. reCAPTCHA may set <em>strictly necessary</em>
            anti-abuse cookies such as <code>rc::a</code> and <code>rc::b</code>. These do not track you for marketing.
        </p>
        <h3>4.3 Hosting Platform</h3>
        <p>
            Our website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which does <strong>not</strong> set any cookies for normal visitors.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            If we introduce new cookies or analytics tools, this policy will be updated and you will be notified via
            the cookie banner.
        </p>
        <h2 id="bbpc-reset-section">6. Change or Withdraw Your Cookie Decision</h2>
        <p>
            You can change your cookie decision at any time. Clicking the button below will reset your
            cookie preferences and show the cookie banner again on your next page load.
        </p>
        <button id="bbpc-reset-cookie-consent" class="button">
            Reset Cookie Preferences
        </button>
        <p>
            This allows you to switch between accepting or rejecting optional cookies if we introduce
            analytics or other non-essential features in the future.
