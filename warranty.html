            <br>
                <h2>6. Our Warranty Process & "No-Hassle" Replacement</h2>
                <p>To obtain warranty service, you must first contact our customer service team at help@bonniebytepc.com with the information listed in Section 7.</p>
            <br>   
                <h3>For Minor Issues:</h3>
                <p>Where possible, we will first attempt to resolve your issue through troubleshooting and support.</p>
            <br>   
                <h3>For Confirmed Hardware Defects:</h3>
                <p>Upon validation of a defect covered by this warranty, BonnieByte PC will act as follows:</p>
            <br>    
                
                    <h3>Standard Process</h3>
                    <p>We will provide a pre-paid shipping label for you to return the entire product bundle (all fans, hub, and accessories) to us. Upon receipt and confirmation of the defect, we will ship a brand new, complete replacement unit to you at no charge.</p>
                <br>
                
                
                    <h3>Advanced Replacement (At Our Discretion)</h3>
                    <p>For customers who have established a trustworthy account history, or to ensure minimal downtime, BonnieByte PC may, at its sole discretion, offer an "Advanced Replacement." Under this program, we will ship a new replacement unit to you immediately, alongside providing a pre-paid label to return the faulty unit. You are required to return the original faulty unit within 14 days using the provided label. Failure to do so will result in a charge for the cost of the replacement unit.</p>
               <br>
                
                <p>This process ensures you always receive a complete, new, and fully tested product bundle, maintaining the integrity and performance of your PC cooling solution.</p>
